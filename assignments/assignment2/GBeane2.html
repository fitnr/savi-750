Population Density / World GDP Map

This map shows global population density relative to GDP -- for both countries and individual cities. The map is impressive in the breadth and specificity of data it presents. However, as it tries to make the point that megacities are responsible for large proportions of national and global GPDP, choices about map style end up confusing the imageâ€™s message. For instance, cities and countries are displayed with the same font and font size, making it difficult to distinguish between the two. Some cities are shown without accompanying GDP figures (presumably because their GDP is too low to register). Because city names and GDP circles are offset from their proper geographic locations, it becomes difficult to make a visual connection between high population density and GDP.

The data may be better displayed as a series of maps, graphs or charts, or in text. A title and explanatory text might make the graphic more legible. As presented here, the map requires excessive time and concentration from the reader.
