<a id='course-overview'></a>
###Course Overview
This course introduces the tools, techniques, and general approaches used to acquire, clean, analyze, and visualize open data, with particular emphasis on using web-based technologies and open-source tools at each step of the process.

We will be working with the community preservation group [Save Harlem Now!](http://www.saveharlemnow.org/) to help collect, organize, and visualize data related to historic preservation in Harlem. There is no requirement to participate in this project and each student is free to pursue their own projects in class. The work with Save Harlem Now! is an opportunity to work on a real-world problem related to the collection, analysis, and visualization of data.

The books listed in the Suggested Readings section below offer even more depth and an extended discussion of the material we cover in class. **Readings are due for the class under which they're listed.**

######[back to top](#top)

<a id='class-format'></a>
###Class Format 
Class runs from 6:30pm to 9:30pm, with the class time broken up into two 85-minute blocks with a single 10-minute break around the half-way point of the class. Class will be a mix of lecture and practical exercise work, emphasizing the application of skills covered in the lecture portion of the class. 

I will also be available for questions or further assistance before and after class. You will have ample time in class to work on practical exercises based on the information presented in lectures. When possible, the final half hour of class will be set aside for any additional questions or additional tutorials in tools, skills, or techniques. Please plan on attending the full class time.

######[back to top](#top)

<a id='submitting-assignments'></a>
###Submitting Assignments
All assignments will be submitted by adding your content to the [class page](https://github.com/datapolitan/MiningTheWeb) and issuing a "[pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/)" in the [class repository](https://github.com/datapolitan/MiningTheWeb). All of this will be explained, setup, and otherwise clarified on the first day of class. **Assignments aren't considered submitted until the pull request has been issued.** We will have ample time in class to address any technical issues and a reference guide for the process.
