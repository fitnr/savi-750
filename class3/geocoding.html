## Geocoding

### [Download this file](class3.csv)

And inspect it with `csvkit`

--

Sample commands:

````bash
head -n 1 class3.csv
csvstat class3.csv
````

## Geocoding with the Census API and Python

Our goal is to get a coordinate for every citation.

--
+ Read each line in CSV

--
+ construct an address from the fields

--
+ geocode the address

--
+ Save the output to a new CSV

---
## Geocoding with the Census API and Python

Install the censusgeocode package
+ Go to your `bash` command line
+ `pip install --user censusgeocode`

--

This will make the geocoding part easier. Most popular APIs have a corresponding Python library that takes care of the heavy lifting

---

## Geocoding with the Census API and Python

### Step 1: read each line of the CSV

Add the csv module to your code
````python
import csv
````

--
Open the file and prepare to turn each row into a `dict`ionary
````python
with open('class3.csv') as f:
  reader = csv.DictReader(f)
````

We're using the `csv` module, let's [open the docs for reference](https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/csv.html).

We can also run `help(csv)` in Python, or `pydoc csv` in bash.

### Step 2: construct an address

Get the first row
````python
row = next(reader)
````

Goal: transform this into something we can send to the Census API via [censusgeocode](https://pypi.org/project/censusgeocode/).

### Step 3: geocode an address

````python
import censusgeocode as cg
````
````python
result = cg.onelineaddress(...)
result = cg.address(...)
````

---

## Geocoding with the Census API and Python

### Step 4: save a new CSV

Use a loop to do something with each row
```python
for row in reader:
    # put the code in here
```

--
````python
fieldnames = [...]
with open('geocoded.csv', 'w') as g:
    csv.DictWriter(f, fieldnames)
````

---
## Geocoding with the Census API and Python

Final product:
````python
import csv
import censusgeocode

# open source and results file
with open('class3.csv') as f, open('geocoded.csv', 'w') as g:
    reader = csv.DictReader(f)
    fieldnames = [...]
    writer = csv.DictWriter(f, fieldnames)
    writer.writeheader()

    # Loop through each row and write the result to the new file
    for row in reader:
        # transform the address
        address = censusgeocode.address(...)
        resultrow = ...
        writer.writerow(resultrow)

````
