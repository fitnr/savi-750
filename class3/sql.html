# Introduction to SQL

---
## SQL

SQL = Structured Query Language

+ In SQL, you describe the result, not the process for getting it

--

+ This simplifies things, at the cost of making the database a little hard to visualize

--

+ There are many varieties of SQL, we're using PostgreSQL, like Carto

--

Hello World!
```sql
select 'Hello World!';
```

---
## SQL

Commas separate fields (just like a CSV) 

```sql
select 'Hello World!', 100, TRUE; 
```
---
## SQL

### Let's look at counties

### Add County Data from Data Library

---

## SQL

The **from** clause pulls fields from a table:

````sql
select name from counties;
````

**name** is the name of a column in the table **counties**

--

```
Mohave
Kittitas
Kearny
Montgomery
```

The result is a set of **rows** (in no particular order)

---
## SQL

### Selecting columns

````sql
select name, geoid from counties;
````
--

````
04015 Mohave
53037 Kittitas
20093 Kearny
17135 Montgomery
````

The result is a set of rows in arbitrary order (and Carto mixes up the columns, too)

--

Use ***** as a wild card to get all the rows of a table:

````sql
select * from counties;
````

---
## SQL

### Where

The **where** clause filters results

````sql
select * from counties where name = 'Kings';
````

--

In this case there are two rows.

---
## SQL

### Comparison operators

* equality: `a = b`
* inequality: `a <> b`, `a != b`
* greater than, greater than or equal: `a > b`, `a >= b`

--

```sql
select * from counties where county = 'Orange';
select * from counties where county <> 'Washington';
```

--

Unlike Python, there's no assignment in SQL. Changing data is done differently.

---
## SQL

Functions change the results

[List of SQL functions](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/functions.html)

````sql
select replace(name, 'e', 'eeeee') from counties;
````

--

````sql
select concat(name, ' County') from counties;
````

--

Concatenation is actually so useful that there's a special shorthand: `||`

````sql
select name || ' County' from counties;
````

---
## SQL

### Aggregates

Aggregate functions summarize the data

````sql
select count(geoid) from counties;
````

--

````sql
select sum(aland) from counties;
````

--

````sql
select min(aland) from counties;
````
````sql
select max(awater) from counties;
````

---
## SQL

### Order and Limit

Explicitly ordering data is often useful when asking questions:

````sql
select * from counties order by aland;
````
````sql
select * from counties order by awater desc
````

--

Limiting the number of rows is very useful when dealing with big datasets.

````sql
select * from counties order by aland desc limit 3;
````
````sql
select * from counties order by awater asc limit 5;
````

---
## SQL

### Recap

````sql
select *
from counties
where name = 'Washington'
order by aland
limit 3
````

--

Select all the columns from the counties table where the `name` is 'Washington', and give me the three results in ascending order by `aland`.

### Joins

---
class: left
## SQL

### Joins

Joins merge two tables

````sql
select *
from apple join orange on (a.id=b.id)
````
--

Very useful for connecting data and geometry tables

````sql
select a.the_geom, b.*
from shapes as a
  join data as b on (a.id=b.id)
````
--

Table aliases save a lot of time!

---
## SQL

### Joining Census geometry to census data

````sql
SELECT shapes.*, a.column
FROM cb_2016_us_county_5m AS shapes
  JOIN data_table AS a ON (a.geo_id2 = shapes.geoid)
````
