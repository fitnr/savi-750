    <h1>Visualizing Targeted Clients</h1>
    <p>By Kimberly Mensah</p>
 

<p> <small> Identify a research question that you would like to explore in this class, with the intention of creating maps and visualizations that will help answer question or clarify the topic. Write 2-3 paragraphs on what question you would like to answer, what data you'd like to explore using, and what you hope to contribute with your work. </small> 
</p>

<p>I am not sure if this is completely rudimentary but I want my research work to incompass other projects I am working on. Alongside working in Clinical Research, I have a few projects I work  on with my friends who have small businesses. </p>

<p>One of those friends is based in Miami. She is a publicist and is working launching her first live conference style workshop. For this event, she wants to incorporate mass mailers into her marketing campaign. I would like to create a series of maps that would help her identify her target demographic which is as follows: 

<p> -African and African American </p>
<p> -Women </p>
<p> -Age 25-32 </p>
<p> -Income 70k-130k </p>
<p> -Has one or more businesses </p>
