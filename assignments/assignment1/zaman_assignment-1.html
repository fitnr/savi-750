<h1 align="center">Assignment#1 Asif Zaman Research Topic: A model for Brownfield Resuscitation using GIS </h1>

<p><font size="5"> My research topic is to create a convienent model that implements GIS in the redevelopment of Brownfields. In other words, find parameters or factors that can be used to assess and make informative decisions in the way Brownfields are resuscitated. The parameters or criterions I would examine about a Brownfield is the location of the site as to the surrounding setting, the soil composition, the type of contamination that was associated with the site, and usage history of the site.</font></p>   
<p><font size="5">For this class, I would like to find relevant data on the brownfields in New Jersey. The data would include the location of the sites, the area, and the historical information of the sites. For starters, I was thinking of creating an interactive map of all the brownfield sites located in New Jersey. The interactive map would be such that a user can click on a specific highlighted brownfield and be able to obtain quick facts about the site, and possibly identify the surrounding environment of the site (e.g. is the site located in a residential area or commercial area). Obviously, this is just something to get the ball rolling for now. I would be interested in further suggestions.</font></p>
