<p> <small> Identify a research question that you would like to explore in this class, with the intention of creating maps and visualizations that will help answer question or clarify the topic. Write 2-3 paragraphs on what question you would like to answer, what data you'd like to explore using, and what you hope to contribute with your work. </small> 
</p>

<p>I am not sure if this is completely rudimentary but I want my research work to incompass other projects I am working on. Alongside working in Clinical Research, I have a few projects I work  on with my friends who have small businesses. </p>

One of those friends is based in Miami. She is a publicist and is working launching her first live conference style workshop. For this event, she wants to incorperate mass mailers into her marketing campaign.

-African and African American
-Women
-Age 25-32
-Income 70k-130k
-Has one or more businessnes
