<p><font size="5">Climate change is one of the most debated issues. The main crux of the climate change debate is the validity of climate change, itself and the process of how humans play a role in it. Many sources and organizations have demonstrated the existence of climate change through various manipulation and visualization of geological, geographical, and climate data (e.g. global temperatures and carbon emissions). Credibility of how data is obtained and interpolated is at question and should be examined to better percieve the existence of climate change.<br><p>This particular visualization was created by Bloomberg View. It's basically an interactive slideshow that informs on the issue of climate change. As you progress through the slides, a globe rotates to different positions and information is either overlayed or placed next to the globe. The interesting aspect of this visualization is the time series component on slides 5 and 10 where you see the concentration of CO2 levels at various locations over a 21 year span.
