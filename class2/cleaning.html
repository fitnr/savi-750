# What is Data Cleaning?
--

+ Removing data
--

+ Adding data

+ Formatting data
--

+ Correcting errors
--

+ Concatenating data together

# Data Cleaning

The line between "cleaning up the data" and "interpreting the data" is very fine.

--

A little friction when you're working with your data is OK - it gives you an excuse to examine what's actually happening in the data.

--

There are many automated tools, but beware! Programs that solve some error may introduce another problem

---

# Data Cleaning

Is just series of tactics. The trick is identifying and stating what the problem is, then finding a tool (or creating one) to fix it.

--

Document what you do and keep a copy of the previous data.

---

# Data Cleaning

Issue: data is too big

Tactic: remove unneeded fields or split into parts

---

# Data Cleaning

Issue: the file is malformed (e.g. extra columns in a CSV, broken JSON)

Tactic: Use a linter to find the bad parts, possibly 

---

# Data Cleaning

Issue: fields have unneccessary or unusual characters
e.g. `50perc` instead of `50%`, `12/31/2018` instead of `2018-12-31`

Tactic: Format the individual fields

---

# Data Cleaning

And this only addresses the formatting of files themselves. Issues of accuracy, precision and confidence are additional worries.

Let's focus on the easy stuff.

---

# Bash Command Line

Commands run with the format:
````bash
command -flags --long-flag arguments
````

All of the parts of the above, except the `command`, are optional:
--

````bash
ls
````
--
````bash
ls -l
````
--
````bash
ls -l ~/Documents
````
--
````bash
ls ~/Documents
````
--
````bash
curl --verbose https://httpbin.org/get
````

---

# Bash Command Line

Think of the command line as a world of text being edited and filtered. There are tools built into the shell scripting language to redirect and accept text.

--

Send text to a file with `>`
````bash
echo a b c > newfile.txt
````

--

Send a file to a command with `<`
````bash
cut -d ' ' -f 2 < newfile.txt
````

--

Send the result of a command to another command with `|` (pipe)
````bash
echo a b c | cut -d ' ' -f 2
````

---

# Bash Command Line

Documentation is usually built-in, there are a couple different ways find it:

````bash
ls -h
csvcut --help
man cat
aws help
````
---

# Bash Command Line
## csvkit

`csvkit` is a set of command line tools for parsing and editing CSV

http://csvkit.readthedocs.io

--

Let's use this example data:

https://github.com/fitnr/savi-750/tree/gh-pages/class2/data

--

And work on

+ Combining (`csvstack`)
+ Transforming (`csvjson`, `in2csv`)
+ Slicing (`csvcut`)
+ And more!
