Weekly Assignment 1

	The Urban Displacement Project investigates the process of gentrification and displacement of lower income households from neighborhoods in San Francisco and surrounding areas. The University of California Berkeley as well as several community –level and governmental organizations contribute to the project through providing data and creating resources and tools to develop a better understanding of past gentrification trends (1990—2013) with the intention of better predicting future patterns. The project provides a detailed and data-driven analysis of the issue of low-income household displacement through separating neighborhoods into categories based on income levels and gentrification risk. The project provides an interactive choropleth map that includes user-friendly legends and tools to help the user navigate through the data. The map page also contains links to reports that explain the research methods and gives a more in-depth explanation of how to determine the risk of displacement. There is also another interactive choropleth map detailing which districts have anti-displacement policies in effect through government initiatives.
	The project successfully created an aesthetically pleasing visualization of the data as well as succeeded in providing the user with clarification on each variable included in the study. The maps allow for users to click over each of the districts to display specific information on that area, and users are able to zoom in and out and observe the boundaries of each district. The website includes key findings, case studies, a timeline of related events, and further resources on the subject. The numerous organizations that came together to create and investigate this database produced a comprehensive breakdown of gentrification patterns that are easily navigable for viewers.  
	The project could benefit from overlaying the policy map onto the displacement map in order to demonstrate whether certain areas are benefiting from policy intervention. The main limitations of this project include that some of the material may be difficult for members of the general public to grasp, and it could benefit from developing a more understandable explanation so that audience members that are not experts in this field have an easier time understanding the analysis process. The excel file included on the displacement map web page contains explanations of each variable analyzed along with where this information is sourced from, but there are no links on the page that provide a comprehensive data file with all of the numerical data used for the making of the map. This may inhibit user satisfaction, as users are not able to easily access the raw data on the same page as the map.
