          <h1 class="page-header">Reality Properties: <br/>Fake Estates <br/><span style ="color:#3E7BB6;">Gordon Matta-Clark, <br/>(1973)<br/></h1><br/>

          <section data-place="overview">
            	<p>In 1973 and 1974 the artist Gordon Matta-Clark bought 15 small parcels of NYC land at auction for $25 - $75 per lot. Each one was either too small for any building or not accessible from the street. </p><p>He came upon these properties while looking for sites for alternative art projects with Alana Heiss (founder of PS1). The city was auctioning off small slivers of land left over from rezoning processes over the years. Some too narrow or small to build on while others are surrounded by residential lots and inaccessible to the street. </p>
            	<p>The story of these lots and their stewardship by Matta-Clark shows the city during a ten year period where these bits of land were sold off at public auction and put in private hands. All of Matta-Clark's lots were bought from a pool of hundreds up for sale from the city through public auctions. All but 3 returned to city hands along with hundreds more that were seized in 1979 for delinqent tax payments. According to Cabinet Magazine (whose editorial team did extensive research on this project in 2005) the city stopped selling the small parcels at auction in 1980 or so. Since then hundreds of these parcels throughout the city remain in city hands. <br/></p>

          		<h2>Lot 1: Block 2497, lot 42</h2>
              <p>53 Drive, Queens, NY<br/>
              Assessed value 2016: $8400</p>
          		<p>At $25-$75 per lot Matta-Clark bought the lots over the course of a few auctions. At the time, $25 - 75 was quite a lot of money for land one couldn't occupy or live on. After the first purchase he did not have enough money for the others he wanted to purchase so his friend Manfred Hecht helped out and transferred the deeds to Matta-Clark's name. As part of the project Matta-Clark went to each site to photograph them, having to cross other peoples' backyards and trespassing to access many.  <br/></p>

              Assessed value 2016: $10,000</p>
          		<p>Matta-Clark was unable to pay the property taxes which amounted to about $25 per year. He gave materials to friend Normal Fisher who paid taxes until his death in 1977. Then materials were returned to Matta-Clark who then died in 1978. The Fake Estates project was not discovered until years later when the box of papers, photographs and records associated with the lots was returned to Jane Crawford in 1979 or 1980. She received notices from New York City Department of Finance about unpaid taxes in 1978, and not knowing what they were about, nor understanding the disorganized box of materials, she left them unpaid. In 1979 the properties were reclaimed by the city through foreclosure for unpaid taxes.</p>

              On Oasis, the New York City land use database, the current owner is recorded as Samuel B. Cohen. Tax documents show owner is unknown with unpaid taxes, but then yet another document shows the land returning to city hands in recent years. Lot 155 was purchased with neighboring lot 155 in 1987. There is no record on line showing what happened to the lot when the others were reclaimed by the city in 1979.</p>

              <p>In the case of Block 672, Lot 106 records show it was joined with Lot #6 on this block. An existing building was built there in 1934 and from aerial photos appears to cover the whole of Lot 6. However, original tax lots show the triangular space sandwiched between 3 industrial buildings. On a visit to the site in the 1990's Matta-Clark's wife Jane Crawford was not allowed access to the lot by the adjacent building owners so they were unable to photograph.</p>

			   	   <h1 style="color:#FF2900;">Brooklyn Odd Lots 2016</h1>
			   	     <p class=”source”>There are hundreds of odd lots in New York City today. After  working with and looking at the New York City tax lot data (NYC Map Pluto) for other projects, I started noticing these little slices of land. I also noticed that NYC has official designations and classifications for these lots that affect what can be built there, on the neighboring lots, and taxes that are collected by the city. The designations must also impact urban planning and development in terms of how various land types can be used. 
               <p> Exploring the tax lots carefully will reveal many lots that are misclassified. Some are shown to be submerged though they clearly aren't. Many interior lots were mis-classefied as "inside" rather than "interior"; an understandable mistake given one doesn't think of mid-street lots as "inside". In making this map I reclassified many of these for my own database. Part way through the project I brought in a new basemap made in Mapbox Studio that allowed me to zoom in much closer revealing many more even smaller odd lots. They remain misclassified for the moment.</p>

              <h2>Tax Lot Taxonomy</h2>
              <p>As classified by New York City (these statistics are based on the data provided in the NYC PLUTO dataset which contains errors): <br/>
              • New York City has classified <span style="font-weight:bold;">677</span> lots as odd; (too skinny to build on, inaccessible from street, submerged or an island) in Brooklyn. They occupy <span style="font-weight:bold;">1,843,962 square feet</span>. Of those square feet 29,134 are listed as owned by the Department of Parks and Recreation.<br/>
              • Brooklyn has <span style="font-weight:bold;">429 </span>interior or inaccessible lots.<br/>
              • Of those lots <span style="font-weight:bold;">75</span> are owned by city, state or federal entities.<br/> 
              • The average size of these lots is <span style="font-weight:bold">1239 square feet</span>.<br/>
              • The smallest is <span style="font-weight:bold">5.85 square feet.</span><br/>
              • The total land area covered by these inaccessible lots that are owned by the Department of Parks and Recreation is <span style="font-weight:bold">23,424 square feet.</span><br/>
              • There are <span style="font-weight:bold">121</span> parcels that are too skinny to build on.<br/>
              • Of those <span style="font-weight:bold">20</span> are owned by the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation.<br/>
              • The average size of the skinny lots is <span style="font-weight:bold">446 square feet</span>.<br/>
              • The average width of the skinny lots is <span style="font-weight:bold">4.5 feet. </span style="font-weight:bold">And <span>2.5 feet</span> for the city owned lots.<br/>
              • Apparently there are <span style="font-weight:bold">eight</span> submerged lots and island lots (surrounded by water, not traffic islands) in Brooklyn<br/>
