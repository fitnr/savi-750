notes on Python - David Weinstein, General Assembly, October 16, 2016

Python is an object-oriented, multi-paradigm functional language. 
Objects are a method. Python uses sublime with terminal translator
Python responds to a  context. It's more like a game than a movie, Python is perpetually moving & changing form: it is never finished.

Makes boolean decisions: true or false.
if 
"do that thing"
If not 
"do nothing"

loops are defined by if, else & while statements
If true.... 
print "this should be printed"

if false....
print "this should not be printed"

else.....

loops control flow

The key concept in Python is how you access values.

[]
square brackets describe a list [return values in a position]
lists have an order

{}
curly brackets define dictionaries. {return values by a key}
dictionaries have no order

to map one thing to another ask: for color in color 
go to something
point to point to something

()
parentheses define variables
following abreviations
length 
len()
len(numbers)

==
two equal signs check for equality

=
one equal sigh checks for corresponding values

elif
combines if with else

:
all _for loop_ statements end with a colon

%
percent is a wildcard
a modulus in python
ex: the number divided by another less one
odd numbers % mod 2=1
even numbers %2=0

#
hashtag comments a line out


pdb
python debugger

import
add library for debugger

cd
changes working directory in terminal, use this to look for a file


moves in sublime:
up arrow copies code above
down arrow copies code below

spaces have meaning
two carriage returns.....
