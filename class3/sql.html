# Introduction to SQL

---

Hello World!
```sql
select 'Hello World!';
```

--

Commas separate fields (just like a CSV) 

```sql
select 'Hello World!', 100, TRUE; 
```

---

## Let's look at counties

### Add County Data from Data Library

![img-full](../images/sql1.png)

---

The **from** clause pulls fields from a table:

````sql
select county from counties_ny;
````

**county** is the name of a column in the table **counties_ny**

--

```
Rockland
Kings
New York
Herkimer
Queens
```

The result is a set of **rows** (in no particular order)

---

## Selecting columns

````sql
select county, fips from counties_ny;
````
--

````
Franklin    36033
Orleans     36073
Westchester 36119
Albany      36001
Sullivan    36105
Kings       36047
````

--

Use ***** as a wild card to get all the rows of a table:

````sql
select * from counties_ny;
````

---

## Where

The **where** clause filters results

````sql
select * from counties_ny where county = 'Rockland';
````

--

```
Rockland
```

In this case there is only one row

---


## Comparison operators

* equality: `a = b`
* inequality: `a <> b`, `a != b`
* greater than, greater than or equal: `a > b`, `a >= b`

--

```sql
select * from counties_ny where county = 'Rockland';
select * from counties_ny where county <> 'Queens';
```

---

Functions change the results

````sql
select concat(county, ' County, ', state_name) from counties_ny;
````

--

````sql
select replace(county, 'e', 'eeeee') from counties_ny;
````

## Aggregates

Aggregate functions summarize the data

````sql
select count(county) from counties_ny;
````

class: left

## Joins

Joins merge two tables

````sql
select *
from apple join orange on (a.id=b.id)
````
--

Very useful for connecting data and geometry tables

````sql
select a.the_geom, b.*
from shapes as a
  join data as b on (a.id=b.id)
````
--

Table aliases save a lot of time!

     , 10.0 / 20
   , cast(pop25up as numeric) as pizza
   , pop25up::numeric / (shapes.aland/2589988.11) as densityadult
  
FROM cb_2016_36_tract_500k as shapes
