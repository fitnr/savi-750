<h1>Mapping Inequality: Redlining in New Deal America.</h1>

<h2> Introduction </h2>
<p>For this weeks assignment I looked at the 
<a href="https://dsl.richmond.edu/panorama/redlining/" target ="_blank">map</a>

 of inequality and redlining  in 1930-1940 America, created by the a consortium of universities (University of Richmond, University of Maryland, Virginia Tech and Johns Hopkins). The map is multi-leveled: the top-level interactive map shows locations in the United States where the researchers identified and collected security maps by HOLC, a housing agency during the New Deal era, responsible for creating and distributing credit-worthiness maps of various american cities and neighborhoods; the zoomed-in level has individual historical maps of from the 1930-1940 that were used by HOLC, government agencies, real estate companies, developers, morgage lenders and policy makers to shape and influence neighborhood development.</p>

<h2> General Thoughs </h2>

<p>I absolutely loved looking at this map and was very happy to have found it. It explores a very important issue in an infomative way and provides the user with necessary tools to research and learn about the history of institutionalized racism in housing practices in the United States. Clicking on the city of interest brings out demographic statistics about the region in 1930 and 1940, so a user can see both the population increase as well as demographic shift in the era of the great migration. There is a scan of the historical maps overlayed on top of the interactive map. Sometimes the top historical map is a bit distorted to match the webmercator projection of the map, which is cool and show how images of maps we are used to are sometimes distorted versions of the projections. Zooming in and clicking on the neighborhood within the city brings out additional documents from HOLC  which led to redlining of certain <i>"unfavorable"</i> neighborhoods and greenlining of <i>"favorable"</i> neighborhoods.  The introduction and the bibliography give very detailed motivation and information about the project.</p>


<h2>User Experience/Design/Data/Tools </h2>
<p>Generally, I think the map is well designed and the user experience is very smooth. The story is comminicated in a straight-forward way and it is easy to use the map and to get the information that you're looking for.  It's cool that the map overlaid the historical maps on top of the modern day map - I think it gives the user a way to connect the practices that  happened almost a century ago to the current demographics, urbanization, development associated with a given neighborhood, city or a region. The maps seem to be all built with Leaflet and jpegs of the historical maps, geojson and shapefiles are available for download. </p>

<h2> Looking at a specific map </h2>

<p>I was curious to look at the area of Brooklyn where I live now to learn about historical redlining practices. </p>

<p>First things that immediately jumps out is how some of the redlined areas are still considered <i>"unfavorable"</i> by the general public. Other areas, like Park Slope and Williamsburg, though historically were redlined, have gone through gentrification processes to make them more <i>"desirable"</i>. Zooming in further into the downtown Brooklyn area tell the reasoning for classification of the neighborhood:</p>
<blockquote>
Detrimental Influences: Heterogeneous Properties. Mixed Race. "Gowanus Canal" has been a slum type area for many years.
