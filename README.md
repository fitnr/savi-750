## Administrative Details

<a id='course-overview'></a>
### Course Overview
This course introduces the tools, techniques, and general approaches used to acquire, clean, analyze, and visualize open data, with particular emphasis on using web-based technologies and open-source tools at each step of the process.

#### Learning objectives
+ You will learn to formulate and articulate a meaningful research question with public open data, as well as meaningfully critique the work of others
+ You will learn how to acquire data through open data portals, application programmer interfaces (APIs), and scraping data from web sites
+ You will learn how to clean data using open source tools in preparation for analysis and visualization
+ You will learn how to conduct exploratory data analysis using descriptive statistics
+ You will learn to visualize your analytical findings in meaningful and visually-engaging graphics, as well as meaningfully critique the work of others
+ You will learn the basics of cartographic design as it relates to visualizing open data

<a id='course-requirements'></a>
### Course Requirements 
**All students will need to bring their own laptop for exercises during class.** Time will be set aside to help install, configure, and run the programs necessary for all assignments, projects, and exercises. Where possible, all programs will be free and open-source.

### Class Format 
Class runs from 9:30am to 5:30pm. Each day will be consist of 80-90–minute blocks broken up by 10-minute breaks and a half-hour break for lunch. Class will be a mix of lecture and practical exercise work, emphasizing the application of skills covered in the lecture portion of the class.

You will have ample time in class to work on practical exercises based on the information presented in lectures. When possible, the final half hour of class will be set aside for any additional questions or additional tutorials in tools, skills, or techniques.

<a id='submitting-assignments'></a>
### Submitting Assignments
