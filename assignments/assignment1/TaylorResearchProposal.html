        Research Proposal (I have two projects I am deciding between, let me know what you think. I prefer the Welfare option but would be willing to work on whichever you think would be better for the tools we learn in class)
    </p>
    <h2>Possibility 1: The Prevalence of Asthma in Low-income neighborhoods</h2>
    <p>
        There have been reports that asthma among children tends to be more prevalent among low-income neighborhoods as these communities tend to live closer to sources of air pollution and are afforded less protections from government environmental organizations. I would like to further investigate the prevalence of asthma or other illnesses caused by air pollution through examining a number of variables that contribute to these trends and determine how poverty affects these variables. Through overlaying maps from data found online I would compare reported accounts of asthma among children, proximity to air pollution sources, and ability to access proper healthcare for individuals affected. </p>
    <p>
        Other data that I would include in the study consists of traffic data in order to better visualize where there are the highest levels of exhaust in the air, the locations of children in their homes as well as at school and how the proximity of either of these locations would contribute to a higher risk of asthma, access to education on the health topic as education could be a resource for prevention, ability to access proper healthcare once these communities are affected by the issue, and other environmental factors that may contribute to a rise in these illnesses. </p>
    <p>
        There are several limitations that need to be considered when participating in this study. Because the air pollution that causes asthma in children tends to most often be sourced from automobile exhaust, the study would be dealing mainly with a non-point source pollution, making it difficult for investigators to determine exactly which sources correlate with incidences of asthma. It is difficult for scientists to prove that proximity to a pollution source is the cause of an illness, as there are many requirements to define illness in an area as a legitimate cluster that can be traced back to the same cause. Pollution and how it travels through the air can be a complicated issue that involves the consideration of many different variables that are beyond the scope of this project, limiting the accuracy of the data analysis. </p>
    <h2>Possibility 2: Government Spending on Welfare</h2>
    <p>
        Through listening to a podcast from the Centre for Investigate Reporting, I learned that Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), otherwise known as welfare, did not only supply money as cash assistance to needy families, but also supplied money for other purposes that were decided upon by state governments rather than federal governments. These other purposes could include programs such as government-funded couples counseling and organizations that steer women away from abortion and instead provide them with parenting advice. The general public views welfare distinctly as a cash assistance program, and are often unaware that this money may be going towards other unrelated programs. As long as the state government officials that are in charge of this money are able to convince the federal government that the programs accomplish goals such as reduce the divorce rate, they are able to provide the money to programs of their choosing. </p>
    <p>
        In this project, I would like to investigate how states are given money through TANF, what states and districts are accomplishing with the money, and how the programs that these states are investing in are affecting the wellbeing of the general population. I would include data on money allocation, the use of money in different programs, poverty levels in different districts and states, money that goes towards actual cash assistance for families, and which governmental officials are in charge of these programs. This data could be converted into overlaying maps that help viewers to better understand where exactly the money in the federal budget for TANF is going. Since welfare tends to be a popular topic within the political sphere, I would like to create series of maps that help to increase the transparency of this system.
