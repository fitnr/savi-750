# How Many Earthquakes Occured in Each Country?

#Steps to Answer

#Steps to Answer
1. Import the World Borders file from the Data Library

---

#Steps to Answer
1. Import the World Borders file from the Data Library
2. Join the datasets together â€“ spatially!

---
## Spatial Join

--

````sql
SELECT b.name, q.place
FROM world_borders as b
    LEFT JOIN all_day AS q
        ON ST_Contains(b.the_geom, q.the_geom)
````
--

Several things going on here
--

+ Aliases for tables (using "**AS**")
--

+ Connecting the two tables with **ST_CONTAINS()**
--

+ This is a one-to-many join

It picks up every row from `world_borders` at least once, perhaps many times

# PostGIS functions

They begin with `ST` and they're amazing.

Summarize the result to count earthquakes

````sql
SELECT
    b.cartodb_id,
    b.the_geom_webmercator,
    b.name,
    count(q.cartodb_id)
FROM world_borders as b
    LEFT JOIN all_day AS q
        ON ST_Contains(b.the_geom, q.the_geom)
GROUP BY b.cartodb_id
````

--
+ A one-to-many join with a summary

--
+ When we `count()`, we use a row from the earthquakes table. Countries with no earthquakes will get zero


---

## More PostGIS Magic

+ Creating lines from series of points (`ST_MakeLine`)

--
+ Adding or subtracting shapes (`ST_Union`, `ST_Difference`)

--
+ Calculating distance, length and area (`ST_Distance`, `ST_Length`, `ST_Area`)

--
+ Generating shapes (`ST_Buffer`, `ST_VoronoiPolygons`)
