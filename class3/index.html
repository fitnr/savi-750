#OpenRefine
--

+ In-browser application
--

+ Used to clean data
--

+ Converts data from various file types
--

+ Exports data into various formats

---

#OpenRefine - Pros
--

+ Works with lots of data types
--

+ Great for converting Excel files to CSV (the carriage return problem)
--

+ Facets are powerful (facet on anything)
--

+ Can export to various formats
--

+ Meant specifically to clean data

---

#OpenRefine - Cons
--

+ In browser memory is limited
--

+ Only display 50 rows at a time
--

+ Meant for cleaning data (not displaying it)

---
