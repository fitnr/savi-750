# Data Types
## Boolean

--
* `True`

--
* `False`

--

Named for George Boole (1815-1864), English mathematician who invented an algebra based two values (`0` and `1`)

---
# Data Types
## String

--

* Strings contain text content
* May include any letter, number or punctuation, in any language, including emoji
* Strings may read left-to-right or right-to-left.
* <u>Strings</u> do not <i>contain</i> <b>style</b>

# Data Types
## String

Strings are represented by one of many character encodings

Encodings are a pattern of representing letters as numbers.

--

A well-known character encoding: Morse code

# Data Types
## String
### Character encodings

common encodings:
+ [`ASCII`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII) (c. 1960)
+ [`ISO 8859-1`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC_8859-1) ("Latin-1")
+ [`Windows-1252`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows-1252) aka `CP-1252`
+ [`UTF-8`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8) (the current de-facto standard)

--

In `Windows-1252`, `café` is:<br>
`99 97 102 233`<br>

In `UTF-8`:<br>
`99 97 102 195 169`<br>

---

# Data Types

Nota bene: Every programming language has a different syntax for handling different data types

Small bits of code are a useful tool for understanding how your computer is processing data (and fixing errors!)

On your command line, enter the command `python`

--

You'll see this:
```
$ python
>>>
```

The '>>>' means that you're now in a Python environment

🐍🐍🐍

---

# Data Types
## String

At best, encoding mistakes often show up as strange characters

--

Converting the `UTF-8` code for "café" to Windows-1252 yields "cafÃ©"

🐍
```python
>>> print u"café".encode("utf8").decode("windows-1252")
cafÃ©
```
---

# Data Types
## String

At worst, encoding issues break things

🐍
```python
>>> print "café".encode("ascii")
```
--
```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<string>", line 1, in <module>
UnicodeDecodeError: 'ascii' codec can't decode byte 0xc3 in position 3: ordinal not in range(128)
```

---

# Data Types
## String

In most older character encodings, each letter is one [byte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte): `a => 1100001`

A byte is 8 bits

--

A dollar is eight bits

# Data Types
## Numeric types

Whole number have different names depending on context

+ `Integer`
+ `int`
+ `Number`

```
1
3445
```

# Data Types
## Numeric types

Numbers with decimals have different names depending on context

+ `decimal`
+ `float`
+ `real`
+ `numeric(10, 5)`

```
5.51
101.0
1e5
6.6667
3.141592653589793
```

# Data Types
## Numeric types

Decimals are even more complicated than words!

--

* Technical internal issue: How many digits is the computer tracking?

  * Precision: Total number of digits in a number
  * Scale: Number of digits to the right of the decimal point

(try this in the CARTO sql console)
````sql
SELECT 11.23456789::NUMERIC(4, 2);
````
````sql
SELECT 11.23456789::NUMERIC(5, 3);
````

--

+ Human issue: How many digits are significant?

# Data types
## Date and time

+ `Date`
+ `time`
+ `datetime`
+ `interval`, `timedelta`

# Data types
## Date and time

+ In computing, `YYYY-MM-DD` format is most common (the way Americans write dates is very unusual)

--
+ In programming, date and time objects usually have a method

--
+ timezones are hard!

---

# Data types
## and more!

There are infinite number of data types, generally based on the combinations and relationships between those discussed 

* `list` or `Array` (ordered groupings)
```
[1, 2, 3]
Array('Apple', 'Pear', 'Orange')
(1.2, 12, 120)
```

--
* `dictionary`, `hash` or `mapping`, groups of `key => value` pairs
````python
{
  'cat': 'meow',
  'dog': 'woof'
}
````
---
# Data types
## Even more data types

* `Geometry` (nested ordered groupings)
```
POINT (-73.9230965166562 40.6974636065591)
```
```
POLYGON ((-73.8548240195881 40.5707431498252,-73.8546956090577 40.570794665052,-73.8544366332235 40.5708993943387,-73.8541496414761 40.5710083658732,-73.8540941616224 40.5702523569784,-73.854174960512 40.5701824229669,-73.854231074553 40.5701346564439,-73.8543297354135 40.5700946397509,-73.8544169852997 40.5700615101435,-73.8548240195881 40.5707431498252))

# Data types
## Comparing types

Converting between types is called casting or coercing. It might be performed automatically, but don't count on it.

--
* A computer can store `123` as an integer or text.

--
* Don't expect `"123"` and `123` to be equal

--
* Don't expect `"01239"` and `1239` to be equal

--
* Don't expect `123.00` and `123` to be equal

--
* Expect `123.00` and `123.0000` are equal

--
* `1` and `0.999999999999999999999999999999999999` just might be equal!
```sql
SELECT 0.999999999999999999999999999999999999;
```

+ comma-separated values

--
+ text documents

--
+ more or less human-readable

--
+ each line is a record

--
+ each record is broken into fields

--
+ fields may be quoted: `1,"Hello, world!",2017-10-25 12:00:00`
