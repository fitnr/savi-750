<head>
  <title>my page</title>
</head>
<body>
  Hello World!
</body>
</html>
```

# Overview of HTML

Other documents can be embedded in HTML. Commonly, images:

```html
<img src="animals/cute/cat.jpg" alt="A furry cat">

<img src="buildings/brick/library.jpg" alt="A brick library">
```

--

And also resources that the browser uses to change the way the HTML is rendered.

---

#Overview of CSS
--

+ Cascading Style Sheet
--

+ Defines styles associated with HTML tags, as well as classes and IDs

---

#Overview of CSS

+ Basic CSS

```css
a {
  color: blue;
}

body {
  font-family: Helvetica;
}

strong {
  color: red;
}

```
---

#Overview of CSS

+ CSS format
+ white space doesn't matter

```css
specifier {
  property: rule;
  property: rule;
}
```

```css
specifier { property: rule; property: rule; }
```

---

#Overview of CSS
+ Different specifiers target different parts of an `html` document

```css
/* a tag */
p {
  color: red;
}

/* a class */
.author {
  color: red;
}

/* an id */
#chapter-1 {
  color: red;
}
```

---

# Combining CSS and HTML

+ CSS can be embedded in an `html` document
````html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>A short conversation</title>
  <style>
    body {
      color: gray;
    }
    .hello {
      color: blue;
    }
  </style>
</head>
<body>
  <p class="hello">How are you?</p>
  <p class="reply">I'm well, thanks</p>
</body>
</html>
````
---
# Combining CSS and HTML

+ CSS can be linked from another document
````html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>A short conversation</title>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
</head>
<body>
  <p class="hello">How are you?</p>
  <p class="reply">I'm well, thanks</p>
</body>
</html>
````
````css
/* This is a file called style.css */
body { color: gray; }
.hello { color: blue; }
````

# Javascript

+ A programming language that's available to every webpage

--
+ Controls interaction, making an `html` page dynamic

--
+ Can make its own requests over the Internet, often uses to load more resources

--
+ Like CSS, Javascript can be embedded in a web page, or linked from another document.

--
+ The complexity of Javascript can be very high, and in practice web developers relies mostly on code *libraries* written by others.

--

Javascript to alter an element of a page:
````javascript
var foo = 'Hello World';
var element = document.getElementById('chapter-1');
element.innerHTML = foo;
````

---
# Overview of Web pages

+ Consist of at least one HTML file and one or more CSS and Javascript files.

--
+ Your browser requests a single resource, which may then lead to downloading more.

--
+ Highly interactive websites likely have loads of complex Javascript.
